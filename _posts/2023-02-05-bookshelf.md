A collection of books I am actively studying. Usually mathematics or
computer-science based, I aim to prove concepts as I encounter them using the
[Lean](https://lean-lang.org/){:target="_blank"} interactive theorem prover. All
proofs are also available in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/){:target="_blank"}.
