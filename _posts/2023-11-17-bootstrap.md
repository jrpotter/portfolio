A C-based CLI for initializing projects in a flexible but deterministic way.
Originally motivated to serve as a better alternative to
[Nix flake templates](https://github.com/NixOS/templates){:target="_blank"},
`bootstrap` allows you to provide different parameters to custom initialization
scripts akin to `npm init`, `django-admin startproject`, etc.
