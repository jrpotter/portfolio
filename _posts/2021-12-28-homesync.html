An experimental Rust-based project for automatically syncing files scross your
desktop to a git repository. Allows upstream and downstream syncing with a
single command, without any need to copy files manually to and from a git
repository. Separately, a daemon can be spawned that watches files for changes
and pushes/pulls them as they happen.
