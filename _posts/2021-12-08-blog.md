I occasionally write about (usually) technical concepts in my blog. Originally
powered by Github Pages, I've since moved the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}-based
project to a self-hosting solution. Theming is provided by
[Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy){:target="_blank"}.
