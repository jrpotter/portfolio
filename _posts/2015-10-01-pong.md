An implementation of the classic pong video game, written from scratch on an
Artix FPGA using System Verilog. This works on a custom ALU intended to process
an arbitrary MIPS program with modified memory configuration: `.text 0x0000`
and `.data 0x2000`. A memory mapped IO scheme is used to draw to the monitor and
interact with the keyboard.
